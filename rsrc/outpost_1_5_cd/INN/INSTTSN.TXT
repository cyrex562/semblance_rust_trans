\\setupPrompt
Most modems will work with the the standard Modem Setup string provided \
with ImagiNation.  If your modem model is not listed in the Modem Model \
menu, and the default setup string provided does not seem to work, you \
may need to turn off certain modem features.  Specifically, owners of \
modems with error-correction or data-compression must turn off those \
features before entering ImagiNation.  If you are not sure \
whether your modem needs a special setup, or if you don't know \
precisely what to do, please DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES, just \
press ENTER to accept the default setup.
If you need help making changes, please call 1-800-IMAGIN1 (462-4461)

notice a longer delay than most members when you change places because we \
may have to hang up the phone line and dial back in.

Network, and the other will not.  Unfortunately, the only way to tell which \
one you have is to try it.
